## ✅ These 3 are the official, recommended approaches.

### 1️⃣ Expo Managed Workflow

- Expo controls everything (no native code access).
- Quickest way to build.
- Works with Expo Go app (no native build needed).

👉 npx create-expo-app MyApp

### 2️⃣ Expo Bare Workflow

- Expo SDK + native projects (ios/ + android/).
- You can install any React Native native library.
- You need Xcode/Android Studio for builds.

👉 npx create-expo-app MyApp --template bare-minimum

👉 or npx expo prebuild

### 3️⃣ React Native CLI (Pure)

- No Expo at all.
- Maximum control, but you configure everything yourself.
- Used in enterprise or when you don’t want Expo dependencies.

👉 npx react-native init MyApp

## Components

### Smart (container) components

Handle state, business logic, fetching, navigation, etc.

- Fetches data from an API.

- Manages loading state.

- Decides what to render.

### Dumb (presentational) components

Focus only on UI, styles, and receiving props.

- Only cares about how data looks (UI).

- Receives users via props.

## Methods of Storing Local Data in React Native Expo

### AsyncStorage

AsyncStorage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous key-value storage system.
Works in both Expo and React Native CLI.

### Use Cases:

- Storing user preferences and settings
- Caching small pieces of data
- Saving non-sensitive information

install:
``` 
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

### SecureStore

SecureStore provides a secure way to store sensitive data, such as authentication tokens and user credentials. It leverages the device's secure storage mechanisms like iOS Keychain and Android Keystore, ensuring high security.

SecureStore â†’ best in Expo; if not using Expo, prefer  ``` react-native-keychain ```.

### Use Cases:

- Storing authentication tokens
- Saving user credentials
- Keeping sensitive configuration settings

install:
``` 
expo install expo-secure-store
```
